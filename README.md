# üì¶ SICAP Foliador

## üß≠ Overview
**SICAP Foliador** is a lightweight Windows application developed as a complement to the **[SICAP](https://github.com/HermiloOrtega/SICAP)**, designed specifically to manage the creation and tracking of administrative folios (IDs) associated with project contracts.

The system ensures all new documentation linked to contracts has a unique, standardized folio number, improving traceability, auditing, and administrative workflows.

## üí° Idea & Concept
- Simplify the generation of folio IDs for administrative contract documents.
- Enable contract-related document tracking without overwhelming the main **[SICAP application](https://github.com/HermiloOrtega/SICAP)**.
- Centralize folio history and project associations for auditing and operational transparency.

---

## ‚ú® Features & Functionality
- **New Folio Registration**:
  - Automatically generate the next available folio ID.
  - Link folios to active projects and contracts.

- **Folio Tracking**:
  - Display recently generated folios and their associated contract/project metadata.

- **Simple Search Functionality**:
  - Quickly retrieve folios by project name, folio number, or **[SAP ERP](https://www.sap.com/canada/products/erp/what-is-sap-erp.html)** reference.

- **Error Prevention**:
  - Validation checks to avoid duplicate or skipped folio numbers.

- **User Restrictions**:
  - Only authorized administrative personnel permitted to create new folios.
